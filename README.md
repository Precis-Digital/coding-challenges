# Welcome to Precis' Coding Challenges Repository!

## How to Participate in This Repository
1. **Create Your Own Folder**: Make a folder with your name or username in this repository. This will be your personal space where you'll store your solutions.
   
2. **Weekly Challenges**: Each week, add your solution to your folder. We will be pulling the challenges from past years of Advent of Code where each week will have two puzzles - one easier and one harder. Name the files descriptively, something like `Day1.py`, `Day2.java`, or `Day3.rs`, depending on your language of choice. You may also consider adding subfolders under your name with the year, since we most likely will end up with overlapping days across years in the future. If you don't want to keep track of the puzzles by their Advent of Code origins, feel free to just name them by the puzzle number instead.

3. **Spread the Coding Cheer**: Feel free to look around other folders. If you see someone stuck or if you have suggestions, don't hesitate to create an issue or a pull request.

4. **Keep It Fun**: Keep in mind, this is all about having fun and improving your coding skills. So, don't stress too much about finding the perfect solution. Enjoy the process and learn along the way!

## Code of Conduct
- **Be Respectful and Inclusive**: Remember to be kind and respectful to others. This is a community event and everyone is here to learn and have fun.
- **Share, Don't Plagiarize**: While it's okay to take inspiration from others, direct copying of someone else's work without credit is not cool. Let's keep the spirit of fairness and originality alive!
